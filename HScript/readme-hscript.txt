Stuff where I dump scripts. (HScript HX).
HScript is a modified version/portable version of HaxeFlixel which is a good way of mod support for video games made in HaxeFlixel. It supports most things HaxeFlixel can do, but there are limitations to it, its just I don't know what. Some scripts here may not work with normal HaxeFlixel (hence being put in this folder) and some may not work with normal HScript supported games/projects.
Reasons why is because:
-1. I suck at coding (as of writing this, Dec 26th, 2022. 2:07-15 AM)
-2. Some scripts were designed for use with a modified and advanced version of HScript from YoshiCrafter29.

I might peep some coding inspirations here if I update this repo, but here's some as of now.

-CaptainKirby (main inspiration)
-Ninjamuffin99 (Great coder)
-YoshiCrafter29 (Dude's a one man army!)
-Shadow Mario (Sorta, but he's also good at coding.)
-SSNTails (aka A.J. Freda) (Dude's the original main programmer of SRB2. Dude probably has a lot to learn from.
-BetaBits
-WizardMantis#8325 (Dude's also a one man army!)


Original coding inspirations/help/thingies that originally helped with coding and such that I prob don't use/need anymore, or just existed for the time being.


-Khan Academy 
(Original thing that kinda taught me that coding was a thing, but for the code interpreter I just posting the HTMl5 code for the Super Mario Flash 3 website. Oh memories...)

-Scratch 
(In fifth grade, we were supposed to use Scratch for coding. I hadn't thought about it much until I decided I was going to make a game. My friend, Christina Osterkamp, suggested I use Scratch. Scratch became my main programming language to use for a while. I occasionally use it, mainly for vector art and easy programming. I suggest learning with that, then learning HaxeFlixel.

-Friday Night Funkin' (github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin)
(A game I really like. I first was aware of it of videos in my recommendations around the Week 6 update/Sonic Over BF/V.S. Whitty mod came out. I saw a video showcasing the Sonic Over BF and VS Whitty mods over each other. I got inspired and decided to play the game for myself. I sucked at it. I did get better overtime. I remember when I almost died playing Tutorial. For some reason I played Week 6 before the other weeks (less tutorial). I died playing Senpai. Enough with my life story however. Its a good way for me to do coding craps in my opinion. Music slaps too.)
